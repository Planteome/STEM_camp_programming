# STEM_camp_programming
A place to house the ipython notebooks/jupyter notebooks that we will use to introduce biocomputing and bioinformatics to STEM camp attendees.

## Session 1: Day 1 (11a-12p)
The purpose of programming for biology; 
    code outline; 
    identify components of a program (vars/data types, statements, control)
    
## Session 2: Day 2a (9:05-10:45)
Reading from remote data sources, string manipulation and analysis, using modules.

Today's session will cover things like importing data, manipulating and analyzing that data, and exporting/saving data. We will also introduce the concept of using other people's code by importing modules/libraries using python.

## Session 3: Day 2b (11a-12p)
Comparison, looping, and plotting output

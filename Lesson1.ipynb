    "\n",
    "A program -- a.k.a software, application, app -- is a set of instructions on a computing device that accepts input (data), analyzes and/or modifies that input (processing), and provides output (also data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, all activity on a digital computational device consists of \"programs\": operating systems, individual applications, your microwave's programmable timer, the display interface and individual games on XBox Live.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Input examples:__ human-provided text, numbers, button selections (red/green, on/off), files containing data \n",
    "\n",
    "  * (_Input devices:_ keyboards, smartphone touchscreens, mice, file or data transfers from other computers over a network)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Processing examples:__ calculations, decisions (this-or-that), sorting and grouping, transforming data from one form to another\n",

    "* __Output examples:__ text, numbers, graphics, statistical results, charts, video game environment and character response\n",

    "\n",
    "* Computational speed: They can do stuff -- especially calculation -- faster than humans.\n",
    "* Consistency: Repeatable application of rules and systems to data.\n",
    "* Automated communication: Many programs can talk to each other without human intervention (i.e. web services)\n",
    "* Managing the storage of data: ...\n",
    "* Visualization: Can quickly render and display the results of complex data analyses "
